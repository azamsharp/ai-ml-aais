# Module 5 - Reinforcement Learning 

### Objectives: 
- Explain the fundamental components of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) including states, actions, rewards, and transitions. 

- Describe the principles behind Q-Learning and policy gradient methods. 

- Design training environments tailored for specific decision-making tasks. 

- Implement popular frameworks used in reinforcement learning, such as OpenAI Gym and Ray Rllib. 

- Define the principles that underpin deep reinforcement learning, merging neural networks with traditional reinforcement learning.
